StudioCMS is a powerful and flexible content management system (CMS) built with Astro. It is designed to be fast, easy to use, and highly customizable, making it an ideal choice for developers and content creators alike.

Astro is a content-focused framework. Features like content collections and the new content layer make it extremely easy to manage content of any size or form.

However, it is also a solution that basically requires you to be a developer, or at least have a decent amount of knowledge about how Astro uses the files you put into your content directory. Also, the experience it provides is not something you can present to a client or any person just wanting an easy content managing experience. You need a CMS for that.

There’s a lot of CMSs out there, with different flavors and features for your needs, but there is none that completely takes advantage of all of Astro’s capabilities. That’s why StudioCMS exists: a CMS that is completely focused on Astro and that can hook into every single one of its features to provide a highly improved DX.
