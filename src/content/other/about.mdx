I'm a Network Engineer turned Software Developer with a passion for Open Source. I love building tools and resources that help others, and I'm always looking for new ways to contribute to the community.

I've been self-employed since 2019, and in 2024 I started my journey in the Astro community. While learning Astro, I ended up becoming a creator of the StudioCMS project, which is a CMS built with Astro. I recently joined the Astro team as a maintainer, and I'm excited to continue contributing to the ecosystem.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open source projects, or playing minecraft on the public [Station48 Cobblemon](https://station48.xyz) community ran server. I believe in the power of community and collaboration, and I'm always eager to connect with fellow developers and enthusiasts.
